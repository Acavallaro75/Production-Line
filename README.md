## Getting Started

## Built With
- The integrated development environment (IDE) used for this project was IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition. The Java Development Kit (JDK) is Java 8.1.221.
- The database that is implemented in this project is an H2 database. The database contains three tables: employees, product, and production record. The employee database tracks employee's names, usernames, emails, and passwords and is used to verify login information to allow access to the program. The product database tracks the product's ID number, name, type, and manufacturer. The production record database tracks production of the products in the product database and has the following columns: production number, product ID, serial number, and date produced.
- The graphical user interface (GUI) was built using SceneBuilder.
